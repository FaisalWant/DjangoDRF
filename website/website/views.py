"""Site Views

(Views that do not belong in any app but are needed by site.)

I'm breaking the rules here for simplicity: this should not
be in config, as this is not configuration for the project.
However, introducing an app specifically for a single view
would overcomplicate the work we're doing, so it's going
here instead.
